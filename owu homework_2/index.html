            <hr>
            <p>It is believed that roses were grown in many the early civilisations of temperate latitudes from at least
                5000 years ago. They are known to have been grown in ancient <a href="#">Babylon.</a><a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
                Paintings of roses have been
                discovered in Egyptian pyramid tombs from the 14th century BC.<a href="#"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Records
                exist of them being grown in
                <a href="#">Chinese gardens</a> and <a href="#">Greek gardens</a> from at least 500 BC.<a href="#"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a
                        href="#"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Many of the original plant breeders used
                roses
                as a starting material as it is a quick way to obtain results.</p>


            <p>Most of the plants grown in these early gardens are likely to have been species collected from the wild.
                However, there were large numbers of selected varieties being grown from early times; for instance
                numerous
                selections or cultivars of the <a href="#">China rose</a> were in cultivation in China in the first
                millennium
                <a href="#"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

            <p>The significant breeding of modern times started slowly in <a href="#">Europe</a> , from about the 17th
                century. This was
                encouraged by the introduction of new species, and especially by the introduction of the China rose into
                Europe in the 19th century.<a href="#"><sup>[4]</sup></a> An enormous range of roses has been bred since
                then. A major contributor
                in
                the early 19th century was <a href="#">Empress Josephine</a> of France who patronized the development of
                rose breeding
                at
                her gardens ata <a href="#">Malmaison.</a> <a href="#"><sup>[6]</sup></a> As long ago as 1840 a
                collection numbering over one thousand different
                cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by <a href="#">Loddiges
                    nursery</a> for
                <a href="#">Abney Park Cemetery</a> , an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England. <a

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Roses are one of the most popular garden shrubs in the world with both indoor and outdoor appeal.
                They
                possess a number of general features that cause growers and gardeners to choose roses for their
                gardens.
                This includes the wide range of colours they are available in; the generally large size of flower,
                larger
                than most flowers in temperate regions; the variety of size and shape; the wide variety of species
                and
                cultivars that freely hybridize.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>
                <b>Colour of flowers</b>
            </h3>
            <figure>
                <img alt="Yellow Rose" src="./images/colour.jpg">
                <figcaption>An amber-coloured rose</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Rose flowers have historically been cultivated in a diverse number of colours ranging in intensity
                and hue;
                they are also available in countless combinations of colours which result in multicoloured flowers.
                Breeders
                have been able to widen this range through all the options available with the range of pigments in
                the
                species. This gives us yellow, orange, pink, red, white and many combinations of these colours.
                However,
                they lack the blue pigment that would give a true purple or blue colour and until the 21st century
                all true
                blue flowers were created using some form of dye. Now, however, genetic modification is introducing
                the blue
                pigment. Colours are bred through plant breeding programs which have existed for a long time. Roses
                are
                often bred for new and intriguing colour combinations which can fetch premium prices in market.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Classification</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>There is no single system of classification for garden roses. In general, however, roses are placed
                in one of
                three main groups: Wild, Old Garden, and Modern Garden roses. The latter two groups are usually
                subdivided
                further according to hybrid lineage, although due to the complex ancestry of most rose hybrids, such
                distinctions can be imprecise. Growth habit and floral form are also used as means of
                classification. This
                is the most common method to classify roses as it reflects their growth habits.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><b>Wild roses</b></h3>
            <figure>
                <img alt="plant" src="./images/wild.jpg">
                <figcaption>The spring-flowering pimpinellifolia 'Rosa Altaica', underplanted with lamium</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Wild roses, also denominated "species roses", include the natural species and some of their immediate
                hybrid
                descendants. The wild roses commonly grown in gardens include Rosa moschata ("musk rose"), Rosa
                banksiae
                ("Lady Banks' rose"), Rosa pimpinellifolia ("Scots rose" or "burnet rose"), Rosa rubiginosa
                ("sweetbriar" or
                "eglantine"), and Rosa foetida in varieties 'Austrian Copper', 'Persian Double', and 'Harison's
                Yellow'. For
                most of these, the plants found in cultivation are often selected clones that are propagated
                vegetatively.[8] Wild roses are low-maintenance shrubs in comparison to other garden roses, and they
                usually
                tolerate poor soil and some shade. They generally have only one flush of blooms per year, described
                as being
                "non-remontant", unlike remontant, modern roses. Some species have colorful hips in autumn, e. g.
                Rosa
                moyesii, or have colourful autumnal foliage, e. g. Rosa virginiana.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><b>Old garden roses</b></h3>
            <p>An old garden rose is defined as any rose belonging to a class which existed before the introduction
                of the
                first modern rose, La France, in 1867.[4][9] Alternative terms for this group include heritage and
                historic
                roses. In general, Old Garden roses of European or Mediterranean origin are once-blooming woody
                shrubs, with
                notably fragrant, double-flowered blooms primarily in shades of white, pink and crimson-red. The
                shrubs'
                foliage tends to be highly disease-resistant, and they generally bloom only from canes (stems) which
                formed
                in previous years. The introduction of China and Tea roses (see below) roses from East Asia around
                1800 led
                to new classes of Old Garden Roses which bloom on new growth, often repeatedly from spring to fall.
                Most Old
                Garden Roses are classified into one of the following groups.

            <p>Literally "white roses", derived from R. arvensis and the closely allied R. × alba. The latter
                species is a
                hybrid of R. gallica and R. canina.[4] This group contains some of the oldest garden roses. The
                shrubs
                flower once yearly in the spring or early summer with scented blossoms of white or pale pink. They
                frequently have gray-green foliage and a vigorous or climbing habit of growth. Examples are 'Alba
                Semiplena', 'White Rose of York'.[8]

            <p>The Gallica, Gallica Hybrid, or Rose of Provins group is a very old class developed from Rosa
                gallica, which
                is a native of central and southern Europe and western Asia.[4] The "Apothecary's Rose", R. gallica
                varietas
                officinalis, was grown in the Middle Ages in monastic herbaria for its alleged medicinal properties,
                and
                became famous in English history as the Red Rose of Lancaster. Gallicas are shrubs that rarely grow
                over 4
                feet (1.25 m) tall and flower once in Summer. Unlike most other once-blooming Old Garden Roses,
                gallicas
                include cultivars with flowers in hues of red, maroon, and purplish crimson. Examples include
                'Cardinal de
                Richelieu', 'Charles de Mills', and 'Rosa Mundi' (R. gallica varietas versicolor).</p>

            <p>Main article: Rosa x damascena</p>
            <p> Named for Damascus, Damask roses (Rosa × damascena) originated in ancient times with a natural
                hybrid (Rosa
                moschata × Rosa gallica) × Rosa fedtschenkoana.[10] Robert de Brie is given credit for bringing
                damask roses
                from the Middle East to Europe sometime between 1254 and 1276, although there is evidence from
                ancient Roman
                frescoes that at least one damask rose existed in Europe for hundreds of years before this. Summer
                damasks
                bloom once in summer. Autumn or Four Seasons damasks bloom again later, albeit less exuberantly, and
                these
                were the first remontant (repeat-flowering) Old European roses. Damask roses tend to have rangy to
                sprawling
                growth habits and strongly scented blooms. Examples: 'Ispahan', 'Madame Hardy'.</p>

            <h4><b>Centifolia or Provence</b></h4>
            <p>Main article: Rosa x centifolia</p>
            <p> Centifolia roses are also known as Cabbage roses, or as Provence roses. They are derived from Rosa ×
                centifolia, a hybrid that appeared in the 17th century in the Netherlands,[4] related to damask
                roses. They
                are named for their "one hundred" petals; they are often called "cabbage" roses due to the globular
                shape of
                the flowers. The centifolias are all once-flowering. As a class, they are notable for their
                inclination to
                produce mutations of various sizes and forms, including moss roses and some of the first miniature
                roses
                (see below). Examples: 'Centifolia', 'Paul Ricault'.</p>

            <h4><b>Moss</b></h4>
            <p>Main article: Rosa × centifolia </p>
            <p>The Moss roses are based on one or more mutations, particularly one that appeared early on Rosa ×
                centifolia,
                the Provence or cabbage rose.[4][11] Some with Damask roses as a parent may be derived from a
                separate
                mutation.[11] Thickly growing or branched resin-bearing hairs, particularly on the sepals, are
                considered to
                resemble moss and give off a pleasant woods or balsam scent when rubbed. Moss roses are cherished
                for this
                trait, but as a group they have not contributed to the development of new rose classifications.
                Various
                hybrids with other roses have yielded different forms, such as the modern miniature creeping moss
                rose 'Red
                Moss Rambler' (Ralph S. Moore, 1990). Moss roses with centifolia background are once-flowering; some
                moss
                roses exhibit repeat-blooming, indicative of Autumn Damask parentage. Examples: 'Common Moss'
                (centifolia-moss), 'Mousseline', also known as 'Alfred de Dalmas' (Autumn Damask moss).</p>

            <h4><b>Portland</b></h4>
            <p>The Portland roses were long thought to be the first group of crosses between China roses and
                European roses,
                and to show the influence of Rosa chinensis. Recent DNA analysis however has demonstrated that the
                original
                Portland Rose has no Chinese ancestry, but has an autumn damask/gallica lineage.[12] This group of
                roses was
                named after the Duchess of Portland who received (from Italy about 1775) a rose then known as R.
                paestana or
                'Scarlet Four Seasons' Rose' (now known simply as 'The Portland Rose'). The whole class of Portland
                roses
                was developed from that one rose. The first repeat-flowering class of rose with fancy European-style
                blossoms, the plants tend to be fairly short and shrubby, with a suckering habit, with
                proportionately short
                flower stalks. The main flowering is in the summer, but intermittent flowers continue into the
                autumn.
                Examples: 'James Veitch', 'Rose de Rescht', 'Comte de Chambord'.</p>

            <p><i>Main article: Rosa chinensis</i></p>
            <p>The China roses, based on Rosa chinensis, have been cultivated in East Asia for centuries. They have
                been
                cultivated in Western Europe since the late 18th century. They contribute much to the parentage of
                today's
                hybrid roses,[13] and they brought a change to the form of the flowers then cultivated in
                Europe.[14]
                Compared with the older rose classes known in Europe, the Chinese roses had less fragrant, smaller
                blooms
                carried over twiggier, more cold-sensitive shrubs. However they could bloom repeatedly throughout
                the summer
                and into late autumn, unlike their European counterparts. The flowers of China roses were also
                notable for
                their tendency to "suntan," or darken over time unlike other blooms which tended to fade after
                opening.[14]
                This made them highly desirable for hybridisation purposes in the early 19th century. According to
                Graham
                Stuart Thomas, China roses are the class upon which modern roses are built.[14] Today's exhibition
                rose owes
                its form to the China genes, and the China roses also brought slender buds which unfurl when
                opening.[14]
                Tradition holds that four "stud China" roses—'Slater's Crimson China' (1792), 'Parsons' Pink China'
                (1793),
                and the Tea roses 'Hume's Blush Tea-scented China' (1809) and 'Parks' Yellow Tea-scented China'
                (1824)—were
                brought to Europe in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; in fact there were rather more, at
                least five
                Chinas not counting the Teas having been imported.[15] This brought about the creation of the first
                classes
                of repeat-flowering Old Garden Roses, and later the Modern Garden Roses. Examples: 'Old Blush
                China',
                'Mutabilis' (Butterfly Rose), 'Cramoisi Superieur'.</p>

                <figcaption>Tea rose 'Mrs Dudley Cross' (Paul 1907)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The original Tea-scented Chinas (Rosa × odorata) were Oriental cultivars thought to represent hybrids
                of R.
                chinensis with R. gigantea, a large Asian climbing rose with pale-yellow blossoms.[4] Immediately
                upon their
                introduction in the early 19th-century breeders went to work with them, especially in France,
                crossing them
                first with China roses and then with Bourbons and Noisettes. The Tea roses are repeat-flowering
                roses, named
                for their fragrance being reminiscent of Chinese black tea (although this is not always the case).
                The
                colour range includes pastel shades of white, pink and (a novelty at the time) yellow to apricot.
                The
                individual flowers of many cultivars are semi-pendent and nodding, due to weak flower stalks. In a
                "typical"
                Tea, pointed buds produce high-centred blooms which unfurl in a spiral fashion, and the petals tend
                to roll
                back at the edges, producing a petal with a pointed tip; the Teas are thus the originators of
                today's
                "classic" florists' rose form. According to rose historian Brent Dickerson, the Tea classification
                owes as
                much to marketing as to botany; 19th-century nurserymen would label their Asian-based cultivars as
                "Teas" if
                they possessed the desirable Tea flower form, and "Chinas" if they did not.[16] Like the Chinas, the
                Teas
                are not hardy in colder climates. Examples: 'Lady Hillingdon', 'Maman Cochet', 'Duchesse de
                Brabant', 'Mrs.
                Foley Hobbs'.</p>

            <p>Bourbon roses originated on the Île Bourbon (now called Réunion) off the coast of Madagascar in the
                Indian
                Ocean. They are believed to be the result of a cross between the Autumn Damask and the 'Old Blush'
                China
                rose, both of which were frequently used as hedging materials on the island.[4] They flower
                repeatedly on
                vigorous, frequently semi-climbing shrubs with glossy foliage and purple-tinted canes. They were
                first
                Introduced in France in 1820 by Henri Antoine Jacques. Examples: 'Louise Odier', 'Mme. Pierre Oger',
                'Zéphirine Drouhin' (the last example is often classified under climbing roses).</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The first Noisette rose was raised as a hybrid seedling by a South Carolina rice planter named John
                Champneys.[4] Its parents were the China rose 'Parson's Pink' and the autumn-flowering musk rose
                (Rosa
                moschata), resulting in a vigorous climbing rose producing huge clusters of small pink flowers from
                spring
                to fall. Champneys sent seedlings of his rose (called 'Champneys' Pink Cluster') to his gardening
                friend,
                Philippe Noisette, who in turn sent plants to his brother Louis in Paris, who then introduced 'Blush
                Noisette' in 1817. The first Noisettes were small-blossomed, fairly winter-hardy climbers, but later
                infusions of Tea rose genes created a Tea-Noisette subclass with larger flowers, smaller clusters,
                and
                considerably reduced winter hardiness. Examples: 'Blush Noisette', 'Lamarque' (Noisette); 'Mme.
                Alfred
                Carriere', 'Marechal Niel' (Tea-Noisette). (See French and German articles on Noisette roses)</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The dominant class of roses in Victorian England, hybrid perpetuals, their name being a misleading
                translation of "hybrides remontants" ("reblooming hybrids"), emerged in 1838 as the first roses
                which
                successfully combined Asian remontancy (repeat blooming) with the old European lineages.[4] Because
                remontancy is a recessive trait, the first generation of Asian and European crosses, i. e., hybrid
                Chinas,
                hybrid bourbons, and hybrid noisettes, were stubbornly non-remontant, but when these roses were
                re-crossed
                with themselves or with Chinas or teas, some of their offspring flowered more than once. The hybrid
                perpetuals thus were something of a miscellaneous, catch-all class derived to a great extent from
                the
                bourbons but with admixtures of Chinas, teas, damasks, gallicas, and to a lesser extent noisettes,
                albas,
                and even centifolias.[17] They became the most popular garden and florist roses of northern Europe
                at the
                time, as the tender tea roses would not thrive in cold climates, and the hybrid perpetuals' very
                large
                blooms were well suited to the new phenomenon of competitive exhibitions. The "perpetual" in the
                name
                suggests their remontancy, but many varieties of this class only poorly exhibited the property; the
                tendency
                was for a massive vernal bloom followed by either scattered summer flowering, a smaller autumnal
                burst, or
                sometimes no re-flowering in that year. Due to a limited colour palette of white, pink, and red, and
                a lack
                of reliable remontancy, the hybrid perpetuals were finally overshadowed by their descendants, the
                hybrid
                teas. Examples include 'Général Jacqueminot', 'Ferdinand Pichard', 'Paul Neyron', and 'Reine des
                Violettes'.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Although they arose too late to qualify technically as old garden roses, the hybrid musks are often
                informally classed with them, since their growth habits and care are much more like the old garden
                roses
                than modern roses. The hybrid musk group was mainly developed by Rev. Joseph Pemberton, a British
                rosarian,
                in the first decades of the 20th century, based upon 'Aglaia', an 1896 cross by Peter Lambert. A
                seedling of
                this rose, 'Trier', is considered to the foundation of the class.[4] The genetics of the class are
                somewhat
                obscure, as some of the parents are unknown. Rosa multiflora, however, is known to be one parent,
                and Rosa
                moschata (the musk rose) also figures in its heritage, though it is considered to be less important
                than the
                name would suggest. Hybrid musks are disease-resistant, repeat flowering and generally
                cluster-flowered,
                with a strong, characteristic "musk" scent.[18] The stems tend to be lax and arching, with limited
                thorns.[8] Examples include 'Buff Beauty' and 'Penelope'.</p>

            <p>The hybrid rugosas likewise are not officially old garden roses, but tend to be included in them.
                Derived
                from Rosa rugosa ("Japanese rose"), native to Japan and Korea and introduced into the West circa the
                1880s,
                these vigorous roses are extremely hardy with excellent disease resistance. Most are extremely
                fragrant,
                remontant, and produce moderately double, flat flowers. The defining characteristic of a hybrid
                rugosa rose
                is its rugose, i. e., wrinkly foliage, but some hybrid rugosas lack this trait. These roses often
                set large
                hips. Examples include 'Hansa' and 'Roseraie de l'Häy'.</p>

            <h4><b>Bermuda "Mystery" roses</b></h4>
            <p>This is a group of several dozen "found" roses grown in Bermuda for at least a century. The roses
                have
                significant value and interest for those growing roses in tropical and semi-tropical regions, since
                they are
                highly resistant to both nematode damage and the fungal diseases that plague rose culture in hot,
                humid
                areas. Most of these roses are thought to be Old Garden Rose cultivars that have otherwise dropped
                out of
                cultivation, or sports thereof. They are "mystery roses" because their "proper" historical names
                have been
                lost. Tradition dictates that they are named after the owner of the garden where they were
                rediscovered.</p>

            <p><i>Main article: Hybrid tea rose</i></p>
            <p>The favourite rose for much of the history of modern roses, hybrid teas were initially created by
                hybridising
                hybrid perpetuals with Tea roses in the late 19th century. 'La France', created in 1867, is
                universally
                acknowledged as the first indication of a new class of roses. Hybrid teas exhibit traits midway
                between both
                parents: hardier than the teas but less hardy than the hybrid perpetuals, and more ever-blooming
                than the
                hybrid perpetuals but less so than the teas. The flowers are well-formed with large, high-centred
                buds, and
                each flowering stem typically terminates in a single shapely bloom. The shrubs tend to be stiffly
                upright
                and sparsely foliaged, which today is often seen as a liability because it makes them more difficult
                to
                place in the garden or landscape. Hybrid teas became the single most popular garden rose of the 20th
                century; today, their reputation as high maintenance plants has led to a decline in popularity. The
                hybrid
                tea remains the standard rose of the floral industry, however, and is still favoured in formal
                situations.
                Examples: 'Peace' (yellow), 'Garden Party' (white), 'Mister Lincoln' (red) and 'Double Delight'
                (bi-colour
                cream and red).</p>

                <figcaption>Pernetiana rose 'Soleil d'Or', the first of its class (Pernet 1900)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The French breeder Joseph Pernet-Ducher initiated the first class of roses to include genes from the
                old
                Austrian briar rose (Rosa foetida) with his 1900 introduction of 'Soleil d'Or.'[4] This resulted in
                an
                entirely new colour range for roses: shades of deep yellow, apricot, copper, orange, true scarlet,
                yellow
                bicolours, lavender, gray, and even brown were now possible. Originally considered a separate class,
                the
                Pernetianas or Hybrid Foetidas were officially merged into the Hybrid Teas in 1930. The new colour
                range did
                much to increase hybrid tea popularity in the 20th century, but these colours came at a price: Rosa
                foetida
                also passed on a tendency toward disease-susceptibility, scentless blooms, and an intolerance of
                pruning to
                its descendants.</p>

            <h4><b>Polyantha</b></h4>
            <p>The name of this class literally means "many-flowered", from the Greek "poly" ("many") and "anthos"
                ("flower"). Originally derived from crosses between two East Asian species, Rosa chinensis and Rosa
                multiflora, polyanthas first appeared in France in the late 19th century alongside the hybrid teas.
                They are
                short plants, some compact and others spreading in habit, producing tiny blooms (2.5 cm or 1 inch in
                diameter on average) in large sprays in the typical rose colours of white, pink, and red. Their
                popularity
                derived from their prolific blooming: from spring to autumn; a healthy polyantha shrub truly might
                be
                covered in flowers, making a strong colour impact in the landscape.</p>

            <p>Polyantha roses are still popular and regarded as low-maintenance, disease-resistant, garden roses.
                The class
                of roses denominated "Multiflora Hybrids" are probably cognizable as polyanthas. Examples include
                Rosa
                'Cécile Brünner', 'The Fairy', 'Pink Fairy', and 'Red Fairy'.</p>

                <figcaption>Rosa 'Borussia', a modern floribunda rose</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><i>Main article: Floribunda (rose)</i></p>
            <p>Some rose breeders recognized potential in crossing polyanthas with hybrid teas, to create roses that
                bloomed
                with the profusion of polyanthas and possessed the floral beauty and breadth of coloration of hybrid
                teas.
                In 1907, the Danish breeder Dines Poulsen introduced the first cross of a polyantha and hybrid tea,
                denominated 'Rödhätte'.[11] This hybrid had some characteristics of both of its parental classes,
                and was
                denominated a "Hybrid Polyantha" or "Poulsen" rose.[11] Further and similar introductions followed
                from
                Poulsen, these often bearing the family name, e. g., 'Else Poulsen' (1924).[11] Because their hybrid
                characteristics separated them from polyanthas and hybrid teas, the new class eventually was named
                Floribunda, Latin for "many-flowering". Typical floribundas are stiff shrubs that are smaller and
                bushier
                than the average hybrid tea, but less dense and sprawling than the average polyantha. The flowers
                are often
                smaller than those of hybrid teas but are produced in large sprays that give a better floral effect
                in the
                garden. Floribundas are found in all hybrid tea colours and often with the classic, hybrid
                tea-shaped
                blossom. Sometimes they differ from hybrid teas only in their cluster flowered habit. They are still
                planted
                in large bedding schemes in public parks and suitable gardens. Examples include 'Anne Harkness',
                'Dainty
                Maid', 'Iceberg', and 'Tuscan Sun'.</p>

            <h4><b>Grandiflora</b></h4>
            <p>Grandifloras, Latin for "large-flowered", are the class of roses created in the middle of the 20th
                century as
                back crosses of hybrid teas and floribundas that fit neither category, specifically, Rosa 'Queen
                Elizabeth',
                which was introduced in 1954.[19] Grandiflora roses are shrubs that are typically larger than both
                hybrid
                teas and floribundas and produce flowers that resemble those of hybrid teas and are borne in small
                clusters
                of three to five, similar to floribundas. Grandifloras were somewhat popular from circa 1954 into
                the 1980s,
                but today they are much less popular than both hybrid teas and floribundas. Examples include:
                'Comanche,'
                'Montezuma', and 'Queen Elizabeth'.</p>

            <p>Dwarf mutations of some Old Garden Roses—gallicas and centifolias—were known in Europe in the 17th
                century,
                although these were once-flowering just as their larger forms were. Miniature forms of
                repeat-flowering
                China roses were also grown and bred in China, and are depicted in 18th-century Chinese art. Modern
                miniature roses largely derive from such miniature China roses, especially the cultivar 'Roulettii',
                a
                chance discovery found in a pot in Switzerland.[20]
            </p>
            <p>Miniature roses are represented by twiggy, repeat-flowering shrubs ranging from 6" to 36" in height,
                with
                most falling in the 12"–24" height range. Blooms come in all the hybrid tea colours; many varieties
                also
                emulate the classic high centred hybrid tea flower shape. Miniature roses are often marketed and
                sold by the
                floral industry as houseplants, but it is important to remember that these plants are largely
                descended from
                outdoor shrubs native to temperate regions; thus, most miniature rose varieties require an annual
                period of
                cold dormancy to survive. (Examples: 'Petite de Hollande' (Miniature Centifolia, once-blooming),
                'Cupcake'
                (Modern Miniature, repeat-blooming). Additional examples: Scentsational, Tropical Twist.[21]

            <p>All aforementioned classes of roses, both Old and Modern, have "climbing/arching" forms,[21] whereby
                the
                canes of the shrubs grow to be much longer and more flexible than the normal "bush" forms. In the
                Old Garden
                Roses, this is often simply the natural growth habit; for many Modern Roses, however, climbing roses
                are the
                results of spontaneous mutations.[4] For example, 'Climbing Peace' is designated as a "Climbing
                Hybrid Tea,"
                for it is genetically identical to the normal "shrub" form of the 'Peace' hybrid tea rose, except
                that its
                canes are long and flexible, i. e. "climbing." Most Climbing Roses grow 6–20 feet tall and exhibit
                repeat
                blooming.[21]</p>

                also
                exhibit long, flexible canes, but are usually distinguished from true climbers in two ways: a larger
                overall
                size (20–30 feet tall is common) and of a once-blooming habit. Climbing and Rambling Roses are not
                true
                vines such as ivy, clematis, and wisteria because they lack the ability to cling to supports on
                their own
                and must be manually trained and tied over structures, such as arbors and pergolas. Examples include
                'American Pillar' (once-blooming rambler), and 'Blaze' (repeat-blooming climber).</p>
            <p>One of the most vigorous of the Climbing Roses is the Kiftsgate Rose, Rosa filipes 'Kiftsgate', named
                after

                the
                largest rose in the United Kingdom, and has climbed 50 feet high into a copper beech tree.</p>

            <p>Although not officially recognized as a separate class of roses by any established rose authority,
                English
                (aka David Austin) roses are often set aside as such by consumers and retailers alike. Development
                started
                in the 1960s by David Austin of Shropshire, England, who wanted to rekindle interest in Old Garden
                Roses by
                hybridizing them with modern hybrid teas and floribundas.[4] The idea was to create a new group of
                roses
                that featured blooms with old-fashioned shapes and fragrances, evocative of classic gallica, alba
                and
                "damask" roses, but with modern repeat-blooming characteristics and the larger modern colour range
                as well.
                Austin mostly succeeded in his mission; his tribe of "English" roses, now numbering hundreds of
                varieties,
                has been warmly embraced by the gardening public and are widely available to consumers. David Austin
                roses
                are still actively developed, with new varieties released regularly. The typical winter-hardiness
                and
                disease-resistance of the classic Old Garden Roses has largely been compromised in the process; many
                English
                roses are susceptible to the same disease problems that plague modern hybrid teas and floribundas,
                and many
                are not hardy north of USDA Zone 5. Examples: 'Charles Austin', 'Graham Thomas', 'Mary Rose',
                'Tamora',

            <p>Two main lines of roses were developed for the extreme weather conditions of Canadian winters by
                Agriculture
                Canada at the Morden Research Station in Morden, Manitoba and the Experimental Farm in Ottawa (and
                later at
                L'Assomption, Québec). They are called the Explorer series and the Parkland series.[24] These
                programs have
                now been discontinued, the remaining plant stock has been taken over by private breeders and
                marketed along
                with the Canadian Artists roses as a single series. Derived mostly from crosses of Rosa rugosa or
                the native
                Canadian species Rosa arkansana with other species, these plants are extremely tolerant of cold
                weather,
                some down to −35C.[24] All have repeat bloom.[24] A wide diversity of forms and colours were

            <p>This type of rose was developed mainly for mass amenity planting. In the late 20th century,
                traditional
                hybrid tea and floribunda rose varieties fell out of favour with many gardeners and landscapers, as
                they are
                often labour and chemical intensive plants susceptible to pest and disease problems. So-called
                "landscape"
                roses (also known as "ground cover" roses) have thus been developed to fill the consumer desire for
                a garden
                rose that offers colour, form and fragrance, but is also low maintenance and easy to care for. Most
                have the
                following characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower growing habit, usually under 60 cm (24 inches)</li>
                <li>Repeat flowering</li>
                <li>Disease and pest resistance</li>
                <li>Growing on their own roots.</li>
                <li>Minimal pruning requirements</li>

            </figure>
            <p>Since the 1970s many rose breeders have focused on developing compact roses (typically 1'–4' in
                height and
                spread) that are suitable for smaller gardens, terraces and containers. These combine
                characteristics of
                larger miniature roses and smaller floribundas—resulting in the rather loose classification "patio
                roses",[26] called Minifloras in North America. D. G. Hessayon says the description "patio roses"
                emerged
                after 1996.[27] Some rose catalogues include older polyanthas that have stood the test of time
                (e.g.,
                'Nathalie Nypels', 'Baby Faurax') within their patio selection. Rose breeders, notably Chris Warner
                in the
                UK and the Danish firm of Poulson (under the name of Courtyard Climbers) have also created patio
                climbers,
                small rambler style plants that flower top-to-toe and are suitable for confined areas. It is
                suggested patio
                style roses are protected during winter months due to the exposure environment.[21]</p>

            <h2>Cultivation</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>In the garden, roses are grown as bushes, shrubs or climbers. "Bushes" are usually comparatively low
                growing, often quite upright in habit, with multiple stems emerging near ground level; they are
                often grown formally in beds with other roses. "Shrubs" are usually larger and have a more informal
                or arching habit, and may additionally be placed in a mixed border or grown separately as specimens.
                Certain bush hybrids (and smaller shrubs) may also be grown as "standards", which are plants grafted
                high (typically 1 metre or more) on a rose rootstock, resulting in extra height which can make a
                dominant feature in a floral display. Climbing roses are usually trained to a suitable
                support.[8]</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="rose" src="./images/protect.jpg">
                <figcaption>Roses with protection against freezing</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Roses are commonly propagated by grafting onto a rootstock, which provides sturdiness and vigour, or
                (especially with Old Garden Roses) they may be propagated from hardwood cuttings and allowed to
                develop their own roots.</p>
            <p>Most roses thrive in temperate climates. Those based on warm climate Asian species do well in their
                native sub-tropical environments. Certain species and cultivars can even flourish in tropical
                climates, especially when grafted onto appropriate rootstocks. Most garden roses prefer rich soil
                which is well-watered but well-drained, and perform best in well-lit positions which receive several
                hours of sun a day (although some climbers, some species and most Hybrid Musks will tolerate shade).
                Standard roses require staking.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><b>Pruning</b></h3>
            <p>Rose pruning, sometimes regarded as a horticultural art form, is largely dependent on the type of
                rose to be pruned, the reason for pruning, and the time of year it is at the time of the desired
                pruning.</p>
            <p>Most Old Garden Roses of strict European heritage (albas, damasks, gallicas, etc.) are shrubs that
                bloom once yearly, in late spring or early summer, on two-year-old (or older) canes. Their pruning
                requirements are quite minimal because removal of branches will remove next year's flower buds.
                Hence pruning is usually restricted to just removing weak and spent branches, plus light trimming
                (if necessary) to reduce overall size.[4]</p>
            <p>Modern hybrids, including the hybrid teas, floribundas, grandifloras, modern miniatures, and English
                roses, have a complex genetic background that almost always includes China roses (which are
                descended from Rosa chinensis). China roses were evergrowing, everblooming roses from humid
                subtropical regions that bloomed constantly on any new vegetative growth produced during the growing
                season. Their modern hybrid descendants exhibit similar habits; unlike Old European Roses, modern
                hybrids bloom continuously (until stopped by frost) on any new canes produced during the growing
                season.[28] They therefore require pruning back of any spent flowering stem in order to divert the
                plant's energy into producing new growth and hence new flowers.[4]</p>
            <p>Additionally, modern hybrids planted in cold winter climates will almost universally require a "hard"
                annual pruning (reducing all canes to 8"–12", about 30 cm in height) in early spring. Again, because
                of their complex China rose background, modern hybrids are typically not as cold hardy as European
                Old Garden Roses, and low winter temperatures often desiccate or kill exposed canes. In spring, if
                left unpruned, these damaged canes will often die back all the way to the shrub's root zone,
                resulting in a weakened, disfigured plant. The annual "hard" pruning of hybrid teas and floribundas
                is generally done in early spring.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><b>Deadheading</b></h3>
            <p>This is the practice of removing any spent, faded, withered, or discoloured flowers.[28] The purpose
                is to encourage the plant to focus its energy and resources on forming new shoots and blooms, rather
                than fruit production. Deadheading may also be performed for aesthetic purposes, if spent flowers
                are unsightly. Any roses such as Rosa glauca or Rosa moyesii that are grown for their decorative
                hips should not be deadheaded.[4]

            <h3><b>Pests and diseases</b></h3>
            <p><i>See also: List of rose diseases</i></p>
            <p>Roses are subject to several diseases. The main fungal diseases affecting the leaves are rose black
                spot (Diplocarpon rosae), rose rust (Phragmidium mucronatum), rose powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca
                pannosa) and rose downy mildew (Peronospora sparsa). Stems can be affected by several canker
                diseases, the most commonly seen of which is stem canker (Leptosphaeria coniothyrium). Diseases of
                the root zone include honey fungus (Armillaria spp.), verticillium wilt, and various species of
                phytophthora.</p>
            <p>Fungal leaf diseases affect some cultivars and species more than others. On susceptible plants
                fungicidal sprays may be necessary to prevent infection or reduce severity of attacks. Cultivation
                techniques may also be used, such as ensuring good air circulation around a plant. Stem cankers are
                best treated by pruning out infection as soon as it is noticed. Root diseases are not usually
                possible to treat once infection has occurred; the most practical line of defence is to ensure that
                growing conditions maximise plant health and thereby prevent infection. Phytophthora species are
                waterborne and therefore improving drainage and reducing waterlogging can help reduce infection.</p>
            <p>The main pest affecting roses is the aphid (greenfly), which sucks the sap and weakens the plant. In
                areas where they are endemic Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica) take a heavy toll on rose flowers
                and foliage; rose blooms can also be destroyed by infestations of thrips (Thysanoptera spp). Roses
                are also used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species; see
                list of Lepidoptera that feed on roses. Spraying with insecticide of roses is often recommended but
                if this is done care is needed to minimize the loss of beneficial insects; systemic insecticides
                have the advantage of only affecting insects which feed on the plants.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Conard-Pyle Co. introduced the rose 'Peace' to the US and established the marque Star Roses.
                    'Peace' was bred by Meilland of France (where it was introduced as 'Mme A. Meilland');
                    Conard-Pyle acted as Meilland's US agents, and the rose was renamed for the US market when it

                <li>Poulson, the Danish rose dynasty, was established in 1878 and originally focused on breeding
                    roses hardy enough to withstand the Scandinavian climate. Later introductions notable for their
                    form and colour include 'Chinatown' (1963) and 'Ingrid Bergman' (1984). The nursery developed a
                    number of successful ground cover (landscape) roses, including 'Kent' (1988).[42]
                </li>
                <li>Rose Barni in Tuscany specialises in roses for Mediterranean climates. Notable successes include

                <li>Dr. Walter van Fleet worked for the US Department of Agriculture, focusing on crops, but also
                    developing roses designed to thrive in the American climate. His introductions include 'American
                    Pillar' and 'Dr W. Van Fleet'. After his death, his seedlings - including 'Mary Wallace',
                    'Breeze Hill' and 'Glenn Dale' - were introduced by the American Rose Society as 'dooryard
                    climbers'.[45]
