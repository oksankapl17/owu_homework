                <h2>TRANQUILLITY</h2>
                <p>Description Beautifully rounded flowers, with neatly placed petals making up perfect rosettes. The
                    buds
                    are lightly tinged with yellow but as the flowers open they become pure white. A vigorous shrub; its
                    growth is bushy and upright, clothed in light green foliage, curving outwards in a most attractive
                    manner. With its pure white flowers, this rose lives up to its name. David Austin, 2012.

                    forms a rounded shrub, with ample foliage â€“ the flowers held beautifully poised on long, arching

                    <p>Pretty buds open to beautiful, cupped rosettes of an even, mid pink colouring. They have a light
                        to
                        medium fruity fragrance. It commences flowering exceptionally early in the season and flowers in
                        flushes
                        until well into the autumn. It forms a very healthy, well-balanced shrub with dark green
                        foliage, which
                        shows off the flowers to the very best effect. Named after the daughter of David Austin Junior

                    <p>Exquisite little buds open to half-enclosed cups, eventually becoming wide, shallow,
                        upward-facing cups
                        of pleasing formality. The colour begins as soft-apricot pink, gradually changing to pure soft
                        pink over
                        time. There is a lovely myrrh fragrance. It forms a bushy, yet upright shrub. Named to
